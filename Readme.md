\f0\fs24 \cf0 Temporal Flux\
\
Temporal Flux is a countdown timer that allows you to adjust the speed of time. It was designed for a theatrical application where a timer needed to be displayed in real time to action, but subtle adjustments needed to be made to compensate for the variables of live performance.\
\
In this version, the timer initializes to 15 minutes. \
\
Pressing K starts and stops the countdown.\
Pressing R restarts the countdown to 15 minutes and pauses it.\
\
Pressing J slows down the time it takes for one second to tick.\
Pressing L speeds up the time it takes for one second to tick.\
\
Repeatedly hitting J or L adds to the effect, but it was designed to allow for subtle changes, so one or two presses in either direction should be effective but unnoticeable. Increasing or decreasing the speed beyond that makes a very noticeable effect.\
\
The speed controls are mapped to the J, K, and L keys for allow for easy mapping to external wheel or jog controllers.\
\
The font used is ERBOS DRACO NBP, made by Nate Halley.\
\
Upcoming changes:\
\
- Two window mode, with the countdown full screen on the second display, and a feedback of current speed for the operator on the primary display\
\
- Mechanism for easily setting the initialization time to count from\
